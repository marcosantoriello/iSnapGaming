In order to make the software up and running, you will have to create and populate the database. You can find the files in [this folder](https://github.com/marcosantoriello/iSnapGaming/tree/main/db). In here you will find two files:
- [`createDb.sql`](https://github.com/marcosantoriello/iSnapGaming/blob/main/db/createDb.sql) that will set up the new database once executed;
- [`populateDb.sql`](https://github.com/marcosantoriello/iSnapGaming/blob/main/db/populateDb.sql) that will populate the newly created database.
